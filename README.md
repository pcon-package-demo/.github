# Packaging demo with multiple packages

This is a test of the unlocked packaging structure for Salesforce to demo how multiple packages can be created and used to spin up a Greenfield org using fflib, force dependency injection and at4dx

# Packages

* fflib-apex-mocks - The packaged version of [fflib-apex-mocks](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/fflib-apex-mocks)
* fflib-apex-common - The packaged version of [fflib-apex-common](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/fflib-apex-common)
* force-di - The packaged version of [force-di](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/force-di/)
* at4dx - The packaged version of [at4dx](https://github.com/apex-enterprise-patterns/at4dx/)
* [core](https://github.com/pcon-package-demo/core) - A core level package with some selectors to be injected further up the line
